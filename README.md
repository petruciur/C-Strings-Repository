# C-Strings-Website

We provide a fun, interactive and user-friendly website for those who are eager to explore C++ Strings.
The webpage also comes in handy to students preparing for the BAC Exam of Informatics (Romania).

The main page has a menu that can redirrect to 3 pages:
 - `Introductory Notions` is a subpage that contains the theory required to start working with C++ Strings.
 - `Problems - BAC` provides practice problems with solutions attached for BAC preparation.
 - `Exercises - BAC` provides practice exercises for BAC preparation. There is also a field for each exercise in which one can try different inputting answers until they get it right.
 - The last subpage `source` indicates the sources for the theory provided in `Introductory Notions`. Aditionally, a list of useful learning resources is added for those willing to learn more about the tools used to build this website.
